Hints: grab a weapon as fast as possible and shoot the other player
Functionalities missing:
1) Considering of doing a door but too complicated
2) Didn't do a timer because unnecessary 
3) Didn't do high score because unrealistic 
4) Didn't add mouse interface in guide because unecessary
5) Didn't do much Sound effects as no time

additional Functionalities 
1) Did a challenge system that record wins and kills from file
2) could sort the challenges by name or number of times using comparetor

Bugs:
1) when the game is running, there are a lot of times when 
two keys are pressed at the same time and the character sometimes 
doesn't jump or has some delay.
